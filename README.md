# Wordle Personal Project
 This is a personal project using python, recreating a fun game called Wordle. 

## What is Wordle?
 Wordle is a web-based word game created and developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle. Players have a total of six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with color coded hints given for each letter indicating if the letter is in a correct position, in the word but incorrect position, or not in the word at all.
